#Brackets-ES6 (Brackets ECMAScript 6 Integration)
Brackets-ES6 is an extension made for Brackets in order to integrate, compile and run ECMAScript 6 code from Brackets. It is based on and inspired by the [Brackets Node.js bindings](https://github.com/Acconut/brackets-nodejs) extension.

##Usage
In order to use this extension, first of all, select the desired JavaScript file, then go to the `ECMAScript 6` menu. Click on `Run` to directly run ES6 code. For compiling  the ES6 code to ES5 code click `Compile to ES5` and specify desired output path.

##Installation
Installation can be done in two ways:

1) Installing from extension manager by going to `File` > `Extension Manager` then search for `ECMAScript 6`

2) Installing directly from GitHub. This way you can get the latest version of Brackets-ES6.
`File` > `Extension Manager` > `Install from URL` > `http://github.com/asifmallik/brackets-es6` > `Install`

Enjoy!
